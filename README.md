Debugging
---------

##### Alternative 1: Chrome browser
For general sencha code not involving cordova API the best way to debug is by opening the sencha touch app in Chrome. 
Do this by starting a local web server:

     sencha fs web start -m /<projectfolder>/BIFF/src
     
And the visit http://localhost:1841

##### Alternative 2: Xcode Iphone/Ipad Simulator and Safari
To debug the cordova apiÂ´s you need to run the cordova built version of your app and debug it using the Safari web inspector. 

* Open the Xcode project and select your build target. You can choose from simulators and connected devices. 
* Press the big "play" button in Xcode. This will build the app and open it on your device or simulator
* Open safari and select the "developer". Select your web page in the sub menu
* The Safari web inspector will open up connected to the webview in the cordova app.
